                <h1>Abstract</h1>
                <p>Voice control as a potential method of human-computer interaction is steadily increasing, most recently with watches, cars and household appliances. The elderly should be in focus for more digital development since they are sensitive to bad design. The purpose of the study therefore intends to include this group in a survey of how a voice control system for beds can be formed for the residents of a retirement home.</p>
                
                <p>The aim was to study selected components of a system that the elderly could interact with using their voice to control their adjustable beds. Limitations were conducted mainly in the technical aspects of this system by excluding the use of a technical prototype. The survey was performed using two methods. First, residents of a retirement home were individually interviewed to confirm and strenghten the purpose of the study, that they would benefit of having a voice controlled system to complement the current handheld controller of each of their beds. The results of the interviews lay the foundation for the second part of the study: user tests of a simulated system. In these tests, selected parts of a hypothetical voice control system were evaluated for usefullness.</p>
                
                <p>The results indicate that participants valued simplicity over complex functions in a voice control system. In the feedback test, participants preferred voice over sound as information-carrying. Thus, voice control of beds should be developed with a simple design that is conceptually the same, or very similar, to the participants mental model of the handheld controller.</p>
